# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I feel like I have not changed much based on personal reflections

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I tend to write code in a main function before refactoring the functions, when I do this I tend to miss out on some
variables which then turn into global ones because of carelessness

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I feel that I am able to understand the topics quite easily

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to start remembering to commit my code when I reach certain points instead of finishing them and commiting a done message

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think the marking of variable names or function names can be strict in a sense, sometimes because of the naming conventions that I have to stick to
I end up with multiple things having a similar name, for example, guitar, guitars, user_guitar, I find this problem
also occurring in the assignment where I spend more time changing the names of my lists, variables etc... rather than coding 
the actual assignment which can be frustrating at times.
